This code reads two files:
* XX.smartTable:    contains raw data generated by the smart dining table.
                      The table is assumed to have nothing placed on it during
                      the first 5 seconds. This period is used for computing the
                      tare values.
* XX.groundTruth:   contains manually labeled ground truth for the moments at
                      which bites of food and beverage were put in mouth.
The code segments each image of weights into food containers (plate, cup, and
bowl), detects bites consumed from each food container, then evaluates the
detections against the ground truth moments.
